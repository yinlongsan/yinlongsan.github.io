## Short Bio
I am an associate professor in State Key Laboratory of Processors (SKLP), Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). I got my B.Eng degree and M.Eng degree from Harbin Institute of Technology, and Ph.D degree from The University of Hong Kong advised by Prof. Hayden So in 2016. I worked as a research fellow in National University of Singapore from 2016 to 2018, and thereafter, I joined ICT as an associate professor. My current research interest focuses on domain specific architecture and system, LLM for Chip Design, LLM-based code generation. I am a senior member of IEEE and CCF, and a member of ACM. Please check my [CV](https://liu-cheng.github.io/files/mycv.pdf) for more information.

## Vancancies
I am looking for self-motivated master/intern students for LLM-based intelligent chip designs. It includes various design tasks such as RISC-V SoC design and verification, RISC-V ASIP design automation, domain-specific accelerator generation, Low-power design and optimization. Students with RISC-V processor design and LLM experience are highly preferred. It is possible to work fully remotely. Check the topics in the following list and contact me if you are interested.
- LLM-based SoC/DSA/ASIP design
- LLM-based high-level synthesis
- LLM-based ASIC design, verification, and debugging
- LLM-based EDA parallelization
