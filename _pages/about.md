## Biography
<p style="text-align: justify;">I graduated from Northwestern Polytechnical University (Xi’an) with a bachelor's degree in Electric Engineering in 2012 and from Peking University (Beijing) with a doctoral degree in Microelectronics in 2018. After that, I joined the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2018 and was promoted to associate professor in 2021. With more than ten years of experience in Electric Engineering, now I’m doing research in the field of computer architecture, which is a thriving field aiming to make better use of electric devices and circuits. I have experiences in making various prototypes such as a Monte Carlo device simulator, an Open-Accelerator-Module-based Compute-in-Memory server system, an edge AI computing system and so on. My research interest includes LLM computing system, disaggregated memory system, microkernel operating system and hardware acceleration for simulation. </p>
